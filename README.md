# Health Tracker GPT 🧠💊  
An adaptive, AI-powered assistant designed to track, interpret, and mitigate complex vestibular and balance-related health symptoms — built using GPT logic and enhanced prompt engineering.

## 🧩 Overview
This tool was developed to solve a real-world diagnostic gap — creating a smart, personalized health assistant capable of:
- Identifying patterns across symptoms
- Making early diagnostic suggestions
- Providing actionable tweaks to reduce flare-ups
- Reviewing supplements, brands, and vitamin levels
- Grading food images to detect triggers (e.g., migraine, nausea)
- Offering product and supplement recommendations with reviews
- Tracking daily symptom history and providing long-term insights

Despite a decade of limited medical answers, this assistant correctly predicted a **vestibular migraine** diagnosis within one afternoon of interaction — ahead of formal clinical confirmation.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities
- ✅ GPT-powered symptom and condition analysis  
- 🩺 Suggests vitamins, lifestyle tweaks, and reputable product brands  
- 📊 Image-based food grading for dietary trigger detection  
- 📁 Memory-based conversation retention and flare-up prediction logic  
- 🔍 Responsive, conversational adjustments based on live feedback  
- 🧠 Built using OpenAI's GPT Builder platform with custom logic flows

## 🧪 No Future Dev Needed
This AI has completed its intended mission. While it's no longer actively developed, it's a showcase of adaptive thinking, GPT deployment, and problem-solving — not just code.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- OpenAI GPT Builder (custom build)
- Prompt engineering
- Python logic framework (conceptually aligned)
- Image classification via GPT vision (food grading & pattern detection)
