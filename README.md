Health Tracker GPT 🧠💊
An adaptive AI assistant designed to diagnose, decode, and improve chronic health conditions through smart, conversational logic.

🧩 Project Overview
Built to bridge a critical diagnostic gap, this GPT-powered assistant tracks and interprets vestibular, neurological, and systemic symptoms—offering personalized insight where traditional medicine stalled.

Within one afternoon, it correctly predicted a vestibular migraine diagnosis after years of inconclusive medical visits.

Key capabilities include:
- Identifying symptom patterns over time
- Offering early diagnostic insight and condition suggestions
- Recommending vitamins, supplements, and reputable brands
- Grading food images for potential dietary triggers
- Tracking symptom history and suggesting lifestyle optimizations
- Delivering dynamic, memory-based interaction flow

⚙️ Core Features
✅ GPT-powered symptom analysis & trigger detection
🩺 Personalized supplement suggestions with dosage logic
📊 Food image grading (GPT-Vision) for migraine/diet correlation
📁 Retains session memory to detect patterns and predict flare-ups
🔍 Actively adjusts logic based on user feedback
🧠 Built on OpenAI’s GPT Builder with custom logic trees

🚫 No Ongoing Development
This AI accomplished its mission: helping decode a difficult health issue when no one else could. It now serves as a portfolio showcase of adaptive problem-solving, not just code.

📦 Tech Stack
- OpenAI GPT Builder
- Prompt Engineering
- Conceptual Python Integration
- GPT Vision (food classification & pattern recognition)

🧠 Why It Matters
This wasn’t theory.
This bot made real progress where 10+ years of traditional medicine failed.
It’s a demonstration of what AI can do when pointed at the right problems—even without full-stack engineering.
